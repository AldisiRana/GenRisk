# Toy Example

This folder contains an example on how to run the GenRisk pipeline.
The toy dataset is not real data. It contains about 10,000 SNP and 20 genes, 
2 of which (gene5 and gene17) were synthetically made to produce signals for the included phenotypes.
The signals and phenotypes were simulated using [SIMU](https://github.com/precimed/simu).

## Files:
### Annotated vcf
The annotated vcf contains information about the SNPS, gene, deleteriousness score and allele frequency.
It should also contain samples genotypes. This information is important for the calculation of the gene-based scores.
The toy annotated vcf used in the examples can be downloaded from [here](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/WQroVFBQ8NXNnF1/download).

### snps_list
This file contains the toy significant variants that were used to create the toy phenotypes.
