Methods Comparisons
#####################
We have compared GenRisk scores association test results with different burden test methods.
In this example, we use LDL measurements (adjusted for statin) as phenotype and â‰ƒ160,000 samples from UKbiobank.

We compared the results with SKATO, using the same input as GenRisk for LDL phenotype,
and found that SKATO has detected many genes (58 genes after p-value adjustment) as significant,
including PCSK9 and LDLR. However, the lambda of the p-values is inflated (1.325),
as opposed to GenRisk which had a lambda of 1.056, which means that some of the detected significant genes could be false-positive.

We, also performed two burden tests from rvtest (https://github.com/zhanxw/rvtests), CMC and
Zeggini, and no significant genes were detected with CMC analysis, while Zeggini was able to detect PCSK9 but not LDLR.
